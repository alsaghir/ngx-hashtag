/*
- Global styles are imported here. A custom reset file can be added to override normalize
- Typography (h1-6, p, a, blockquote, etc.) should be included
- Globally defined tags (body, main, article, div, etc.) should also be included
- One @import per line
- The following files are imported as standard ready for customization:
_fonts.scss - This file contains all @font-face declarations, if any.
_helpers.scss -  This file contains CSS helper classes
_typography.scss - Basic typography style for copy text
Additional base stylesheets can be imported

The base/ folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project.
In there, you might find some typographic rules,
and probably a stylesheet (that Iâ€™m used to calling _base.scss),
defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements.
